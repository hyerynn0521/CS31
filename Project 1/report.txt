	With the original.cpp file, I provided 54 as an input to the first question. For the second question, I put 345 which exceeded the total number of Electoral College electors. For the last question, I put 243, which again exceeded the total number of Electoral College electors. This caused the program to output nonsensical results such as "638.9% of the 54 electors voted for the Republican party candidate." and "450.0% of the 54 electors voted for the Democratic party candidate."

For the logic_error.cpp file, a logical error that I introduced was to switch the variable names for pctDemoc and pctRepub. The variable pctDemoc would give a percentage for the republican votes, while pctRepub would give a percentage for the democratic votes, as seen below: 

double pctDemoc = ( 100.0 * republicanVotes ) / totalVoters;
double pctRepub = ( 100.0 * democraticVotes ) / totalVoters;

Although this didn't prevent successful build, it caused the program to output opposite results compared to the program in the original.cpp file.

For the compile_error.cpp file, first error that I introduced was to insert a blank line in the middle of a string as shown below:

cout << "How many Electoral College
    
electors are there? ";

The error messages caused by this error were "Expected expression" and "Missing terminating '"' character" meaning that the line is incomplete and the terminating double quotation(") was missing.

Another error that I introduced was misspelling of the variable pctRepub to pctRepuv in line 29.
As a result, the compiler gave an error message "Use of undeclared identifier 'pctRepuv'," meaning that I was using an invalid variable name that was not declared. It recognized the spelling error and asked "did you mean 'pctRepub'?"
